# SwerveDrive-HC-Blueprint
An Advanced omnidirectional robot drivetrain.

This is our third generation swerve drivetrain made for First Tech Challenge (FTC) inspired by the coaxial swerve drivetrains found in the First Robotics Competition (FRC). 
FTC and FRC are both competitions organized by the non-profit, FIRST, an organization devoted to robotics programs for students from elementry through highschool.

This swerve drivetrain allows robots to move omnidirectionally (strafe up,down,left,right and rotate). Unlike meccanum wheels, the current most popular drivetrain in FTC, swerve offers full traction and power in all directions. Our drivetrain features 4 coaxial pods connected by 4 parallel plates and 1 belly pan. It is powered by 4 bare GoBuilda brushed DC drive motors and 4 Axon Mini V2 servos.
